                <h2>Our Organization</h2>
                <p>ADOMUHA SAFETY CONSCIOUSNESS FOUNDATION (ASCF) is a non-governmental organization established in the year 2020, registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), dedicated to promoting safety awareness and education.</p>
                <p>We carry out this function by empowering secondary school students with the knowledge and skills necessary to prevent and respond to safety threats, thereby reducing security illiteracy in our communities.</p>
                <p>We have successfully delivered impactful safety awareness seminars to numerous secondary schools in Abuja, Nasarawa State, and Lokoja, promoting a culture of safety and responsibility among young minds.</p>
                <p>Recently, we launched a safety awareness guidebook with a target of distributing 60,000 copies to 300 schools across Kogi State. This grand initiative is aimed at reaching vulnerable youth in both schools and communities to eradicate safety illiteracy and reduce exposure to crime. </p>
                <p>Collaboration and sponsorship are essential to the success of this project. With the right partnerships, we can amplify our safety message and make a long-lasting impact on the next generation.</p>
                <p>This initiative has the potential to significantly transform the safety landscape of Kogi State, promoting safety literacy and strengthening resilience among young people.</p>
